            <p>Mohali Defence Academy has introduced a two-year NDA foundation course for students who have completed
                their 10th grade. This integrated program is designed to prepare NDA aspirants for both the written
                examination and SSB interviews, ensuring a strong foundation through high-quality classroom sessions.
                Both boys and girls can begin their NDA preparation immediately after their 10th board exams.</p>

            <p>This course includes coaching for 11th and 12th Science (PCM), along with NDA & NA exam preparation.
                Additionally, students undergo personality development and leadership training to cultivate the
                essential qualities required to become officers. The program also provides thorough SSB interview
                coaching for candidates who qualify for the NDA & NA exam.</p>

            <p>The National Defence Academy is a prestigious institution recognized globally for its excellence in
                military education. It attracts young talent from across the country, shaping them into skilled officers
                and gentlemen. Despite India’s vast population of 1.5 billion, the Armed Forces continue to seek the
                right individuals to join the officers' cadre—a challenge that underscores the importance of proper
                training and guidance.</p>

            <p>As North India’s premier Defence coaching academy, we take pride in nurturing young aspirants and
                equipping them with the skills needed to excel in the NDA written exam and SSB interview. Through our
                NDA cum Schooling program, cadets receive two years of intensive training in personality development and
                leadership while simultaneously completing their Class XII education, preparing them for selection at
                the National Defence Academy (NDA), Khadakwasla.</p>

            <p>Our approach emphasizes holistic personality development, motivating students to reach their full
                potential. We provide top-tier academic training, along with theoretical and practical knowledge, laying
                a strong foundation for success in Defence entrance exams. Additionally, our focused training in
                personality development ensures candidates meet the required standards to clear the NDA and other
                Defence entry examinations.</p>

            <p>As pioneers in coaching for competitive exams in the Air Force, Navy, and Army, we continue to set new
                benchmarks of excellence. Our academy is a hallmark of quality training, making us one of the most
                trusted and recognized institutions for Defence services exam preparation.</p>
