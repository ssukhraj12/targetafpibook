            <p>
                The National Defence Academy â€“ A dream place of many aspirants is located in Khadakwasla (Maharashtra) is a joint training institute of the Indian Armed Forces, where the recommended cadets undergo a rigorous training program for three years before they go for further pre-commission training to their respective service academy.

                An NDA aspirant attempts the written examination twice a year between the age group of 16-1/2 to 19-1/2 years while perusing and after completing 10+2. The selection in the National Defence Academy is a two-phase process, i.e., through a written examination which is conducted by the Union Public Service Commission and an interview which is conducted by the Service Selection Board. Like boys, now girls can join NDA at a young age right after school.

                In today's era of cut-throat competition, after completing graduation, very few students are able to succeed in the field of their studies. That's why we suggest that a student must try to join NDA after schooling. So that the tension between parents and their child will end completely as once the aspirant joins NDA, he/she will pass out by becoming a defence officer where they get a sense of job satisfaction and security in life.
